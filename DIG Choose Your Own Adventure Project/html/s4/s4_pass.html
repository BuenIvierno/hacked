            Amazing idea! Mobile devices are one of the main ways we interact with the internet nowadays.
        </p>
            <br>
        <p>
            And we should take the security of our mobile devices as seriously as we should do with computers 
            A great practice we could incorporate in our routines is to back up our phones
             every so often! That way in case you loose your device you don't loose all your information.

        Also you can always remotely block your device without the fear of loosing any data :)
