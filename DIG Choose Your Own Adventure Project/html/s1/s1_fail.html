               Using the same password for multiple sites, or even storing
               your passwords in a vulnerable non-encrypted location 
               might be a risk factor when navigating digital spaces.
               <br>
               Using a password, again and again, 
               means that your accounts might be vulnerable to data leaks
               or malicious actors trying to access your account on a website 
               with low-security measures. 
               <br> 
               This could put your personal email or even your bank account at risk.
               A password manager is a great way to keep your digital information safe.
               <br>
               Good password managers encrypt all your passwords in an encrypted
               server only accessible by a master password that you create, this
               makes it way harder for cybercriminals to access your information!
