            Great! A password manager is a great way to keep your digital information safe. 
            Using the same password for multiple sites, or even storing your passwords in a 
            vulnerable non-encrypted location might be a risk factor when navigating digital spaces. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Using a password again and again means that your accounts might be vulnerable to data leaks 
            or malicious actors trying to access your account in a website with low security measures.
             This could put your personal email or even your bank account at risk.

            Good password managers encrypt all your passwords in an encrypted server 
            only accesible by a master password that you create, this makes it way harder for 
            cybercriminals to access your information!
