                  Meet June! She is learning cybersecurity 
                  basics just as you are, click on her profile
                 picture to say hi!
                 <br>
                 The internet can be a dangerous place, 
                 luckily June has a magic watch that can 
                 take you both back in time.
                 <br>
                  Try it! click on the watch to 
                  go back in time justbefore
                  you reached this page!  
                <!--  
                    > I want this watch to get me back to previous line of text. 
                        
                    > I would love to have the site have a little 
                      loading animation whenever we go back in time
                -->
                <br>
                  This way you both can learn safely without 
                  putting none of you at risk.
