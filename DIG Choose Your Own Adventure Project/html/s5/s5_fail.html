               June's account was perfectly fine. 
               She was targeted by a phishing attack!
               <br>
               Phishing emails and messages are used by cybercriminals
                to trick users into giving away personal information by
                posing as a legitimate service provider or a person you know. 

               <br> 
               These messages normally ask users to click on a link or download a malicious attachment. 
               <br>
               Once they do this the user is taken to a fake website 
               that looks like the legitimate one, where they are asked
                to enter their personal information.
               <br>
               Cybercriminals then use this information 
               to steal the victim's identity or carry out fraudulent transactions.
               <br>
               <br> 
               A good way to avoid this happening to you is to double-check the sender's email address or phone number before clicking on any links or providing any sensitive information.
