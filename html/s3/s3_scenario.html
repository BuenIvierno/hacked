                Hey! Do you guys have any plans for this weekend?
                I know there is a super cool art exhibition
                at the museum of modern art this Saturday!
                Why don't you connect to this coffeeshop wifi
                to check out if there are still tickets available? 
            </p>

            <div class="scenario_options">

            <a href="/html/s3/s3_fail.html">
                <button> Connect and log in on their site! Let's get those tickets</button>
            </a>

            <a href="/html/s3/s3_pass.html">
                <button> Hmmm, is it safe to connect to this network? </button> 
            </a>
