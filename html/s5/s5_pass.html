        You are a natural at this! 
        June's account was perfectly fine. It turns out she was targeted by a phishing attempt!

    <p>
        Phishing emails and messages are a used by cybercriminals to trick users into giving away personal 
        information by posing as a legitimate service provider or a person you know. 
        These messages normally ask users to click on a link or download an malicious attachment.

   <br>
   <p>
    Once they do this the user is taken to a fake website that looks like the legitimate one,
     where they are asked to enter their personal information.
    Cybercriminals then use this information to steal the victim's
     identity or carry out fraudulent transactions.
   </p>

   <br>

   <p>
     A good way to avoid this happening to you is to double-check the sender's 
     email address or phone number before clicking on any links or providing any sensitive information.
