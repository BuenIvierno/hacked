                    In the last decade cases of cybercrime have increased exponentially.
                    <br>
                    The World Economic Forum warns us that ransomware attacks and 
                    other forms of cybercrime are one of the primary risks to take
                     into account in 2023.
                    <br>
                    While it might seem like cybercriminals might 
                    have nothing to do with you, the first step
                     towards being safe on the internet is to 
                     <strong>take cybersecurity seriously!</strong> 
                    <br>
                    Cybercriminals are looking for ways to
                     make quick and easy money from people's 
                     private information, so don't make it 
                     easy for them to access your digital spaces!
